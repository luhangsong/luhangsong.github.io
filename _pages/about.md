Hi, there! I am a third year master student with an interest in quantum information theory from a multidisciplinary perspective of physics, mathematics, reinforcement learning, and neuroscience. I am now looking for an opportunity of PhD/RA.
I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. XXX](https://www.XXX.com/) of XXX Lab from [School of YYY](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), Chinese academy of sciences. 
You can find my CV here: [Lu-Hang Song's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf) and add my Wechat [Wechat](../images/wechat.jpg) 

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
